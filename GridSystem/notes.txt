Grid System consists of -

1. breakpoint - X-small, Small (sm), Medium (md), Large (lg), Extra Large (xl), Extra extra Large (xxl)
2. container - Wrapper that contains the website -  website width depends on the wrapper width
3. row - always inside container (divivded in 12 equal strips) or column
4. column - always inside row ...all contents should be inside column


Bootstrap flow :

container > row > column > content (text and images)

Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

.container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint (100% for 576px).
.container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints.
.container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint.
